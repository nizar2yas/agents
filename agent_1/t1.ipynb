      "\n",
      "1. **Sunlight is refracted:**  Sunlight is composed of all the colors of the visible spectrum.  When sunlight enters a raindrop, it slows down and bends (refracts) because water is denser than air.  Different wavelengths of light (different colors) bend at slightly different angles.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Sunlight is reflected:**  Once inside the raindrop, the light reflects off the back inner surface of the droplet.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Sunlight is refracted again:**  As the light exits the raindrop, it's refracted again, further separating the colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Dispersion of light:** This double refraction and reflection separates the white sunlight into its constituent colors, creating the spectrum we see as a rainbow.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Observer's perspective:**  You only see a rainbow when you're positioned at the right angle relative to the sun and the falling raindrops.  The rainbow isn't actually located at a specific point in space; it's a phenomenon created by the interaction of light and water droplets, and its position depends on the observer's location.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, rainbows are a result of the refraction and reflection of sunlight within countless water droplets, creating a beautiful display of color.\n",

       "1. **Safety First:**  Always disconnect the power supply before performing any internal inspection or component replacement. Ensure the work area is clean and well-lit.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Visual Inspection:** Carefully examine the X3000 TurboFixer for any obvious signs of damage, such as loose connections, broken wires, physical obstructions, or signs of overheating (burnt components, discoloration).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Diagnostic Tests:** The X3000 TurboFixer features a built-in diagnostic system accessible through the control panel.  Run the diagnostic tests and record any error codes displayed.  Consult Section 2.3 for interpretation of error codes.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Component Checks:** Based on the results of the visual inspection and diagnostic tests, systematically test individual components. This may involve checking voltage levels, resistance, continuity, and signal integrity using a multimeter and other appropriate test equipment.  Refer to Section III for detailed component replacement procedures.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Software Diagnostics:** Access the system's software interface to run more in-depth diagnostics. This may involve checking log files for errors and reviewing sensor data.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Calibration:** If the issue is related to accuracy or positioning, recalibrate the robotic arm and vision system following the procedures outlined in Appendix 4.2.\n",
